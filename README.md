# pyglet-test
Attempt to make a dungeon rpg by reading the least amount of documentation. What could possibly go wrong?

###Why?

For three reasons:

1. The embarrasing lack of proper documentation for [pyglet](http://www.pyglet.org/documentation.html)
2. Because trying on my own might find good solutions that wouldn't exist otherwise if followed best practices since day 0
3. Because 2 will probably wont happen, but trying will make me learn more about game development than following a tutorial.

Because of `2.` I wouldn't recommend anybody using this repo as an example.
